After installing and activating the virtual environment (The commands will differ for windows and Linux installations which is clearly specified in the respective documentation), you can run the following command to install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the required dependencies, you can bring up the main application to validate that it's working in your local environment. To bring up the application, you can run the following command.
